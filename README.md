# Personal_Website_1
My first iteration of HTML, CSS, and JS to make a simple, personal web page. Images from my portfolio have been EXCLUDED in order to reduce the size of the repository. Only images necessary to the function of the page have been included. My personal drawings can be viewed on my Deviant art portfolio.
